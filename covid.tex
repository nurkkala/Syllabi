We will adhere to university guidance regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

  Taylor University is committed to its academic and spiritual mission,
  even as we teach and learn in a global pandemic.
  In the interest of your safety,
  and the health and wellness of others in the classroom, campus, and community,
  you can expect to have social distancing and precautionary measures used in the classroom.
  \textbf{This means you are required to wear your own face mask in class}.
  You may also be asked to remain seated at a distance
  away from other students when you are in the classroom.
  Some larger classes may create discussion groups
  and establish a rotation for some students to join the class
  using virtual tools.
  As students,
  you can expect that your professor will communicate clearly and regularly
  about expectations for this course.
  If course delivery methods need to change or adapt to health concerns,
  updates will be announced in class sessions.
