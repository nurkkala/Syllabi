\section{Course Expectations}

Following are my expectations regarding the course.

\subsection{Attendance}
\label{sec:attendance}

You are required to attend all class sessions.
I will be in class each day, and I expect you to be there also.

In general, I am very understanding about students who must miss class
due to a sanctioned Taylor activity, medical appointment, job interview,
family emergency, and the like.
If possible, let me know in advance that you will not be in class;
I will work with you to arrange make-up instruction, homework, exams, etc.

\subsection{Late Work}

All course assignments will include an unambiguous due date.
Usually, assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date.
If there are multiple sections of a class,
the assignment is due at the beginning of the earliest such section.
Barring exceptional circumstances like those mentioned in section~\ref{sec:attendance},
I expect your work to be submitted \emph{on the due date}.
Late work will \emph{not} be accepted.

This policy on late work is intended to prepare you
for real-world experience after graduation.
In the marketplace,
late work is not merely an inconvenience.
Missing a deadline may
alienate your customer,
upset your manager,
ruin your project,
or terminate your employment!
\emph{Now} is the time to learn the self discipline and time management skills
required to complete your work when it is due.

\subsection{Conduct}

I expect you to be prepared, awake, aware, and participatory during class. I will not
hesitate to ask you to stand or move if you are distracted or sleepy.

I expect you to join in discussions, respond to questions from me and from your
colleagues, and ask questions of me. I expect you to hold my feet to the fire if I am
being unclear, unkind, or contradictory.

\subsection{Gizmos}

You may not use a laptop, tablet, or similar device to check e-mail, engage in social
networking, surf the web, or any other activity not directly relevant
to current classroom activity.
If you use an electronic gizmo during class for legitimate academic purposes
(e.g., note taking), be prepared to demonstrate relevant use on demand
at any time.
