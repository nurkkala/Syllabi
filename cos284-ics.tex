\section{Credit}

This course is based on the Introduction to Computer Systems course
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
Professors Randal Bryant and David O’Hallaron,
who developed the course and wrote the textbook (Section 5),
have generously made available course material
(including notes, syllabi, laboratory exercises, and lecture slides)
for use at other institutions.
I make considerable use of their excellent materials throughout the course
(including in this document!) and wish to credit and thank them.

I have also drawn liberally from previous offerings of this course
at Taylor University,
and wish to thank Professor Jonathan Geisler for his kind assistance.

\section{Course Overview}

The aim of the course is to help you become a better programmer by teaching you
the basic concepts underlying all computer systems. I want you to learn what
really happens when your programs run, so that when things go wrong (as they
always do) you will have the intellectual tools to solve the problem.

Why do you need to understand computer systems if you do all of your
programming in high-level languages? In most of computer science, we're pushed
to make abstractions and stay within their frameworks. But, any abstraction
ignores effects that can become critical. As an analogy, Newtonian mechanics
ignores relativistic effects. The Newtonian abstraction is completely
appropriate for bodies moving at less than \(0.1c\), but higher speeds require
working at a greater level of detail.

The following ``realities'' are some of the major areas where the abstractions
you've learned in previous classes break down:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{An \texttt{int} isn't an integer; a \texttt{float} isn't a real}.
  Our finite representations of numbers have significant limitations,
  and because of these limitations
  we sometimes have to think in terms of bit-level representations.
\item \textbf{You've got to know assembly language}.
  Even if you never write programs in assembly,
  the behavior of a program sometimes cannot be understood
  based purely on the abstraction of a high-level language.
  Furthermore, understanding the effects of bugs
  requires familiarity with the machine-level model.
\item \textbf{Memory matters}.
  Computer memory is not unbounded.
  It must be allocated and managed.
  Memory referencing errors are especially pernicious.
  An erroneous updating of one object can cause a change
  in some logically unrelated object.
  Also, the combination of caching and virtual memory
  provides the functionality of a uniform unbounded address space,
  but not the performance.
\item \textbf{There is more to performance than asymptotic complexity}.
  Constant factors also matter.
  There are systematic ways to evaluate and improve program performance.
\item \textbf{Computers do more than execute instructions}.
  They also need to get data in and out
  and they interact with other systems over networks.
\end{enumerate}

By the end of the course, you will understand these realities in some detail.
As a result, you will have learned skills and knowledge
that will help you throughout your education and career as a computer scientist.

\section{Learning Objectives}

\item Convert a fractional decimal value to its IEEE single- or
  double-precision representation.
\item Read x86 assembly code.

\section{Texts}

The text by Bryant and O'Halaron~\cite{cs:app3} is required.
We will refer to it as \texttt{CS:APP}.
You are \emph{encouraged} to purchase---or have readily available---the
updated edition of ``K\&R,'' the classic reference on C.\cite{k&r}

It is \emph{very important} that you read carefully
the assigned readings in the \texttt{CS:APP} book.
You will get the most benefit if you read assigned passages
\emph{before} they are covered in class.
A detailed guide to reading assignments can be found in the course schedule.

The textbook includes many practice problems throughout the body of each
chapter. These are straightforward exercises that help you understand the
material you have just read by using it \emph{immediately}. For self-study,
solutions for all practice problems appear at the end of each chapter.

In short, the best way to use the textbook to enhance your learning is as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the assigned readings \emph{before} the corresponding class.
\item Work the practice problems \emph{immediately} as you encounter them in
  the text.
\item Check your work—and your understanding—with the answer key.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\section{Labs}

The labs come directly from the textbook authors.
They have a very nice system set up so that you can test and submit
all your programs online and will
already know how you are doing on the assignment prior to submission.
This should make it very easy to know when you have a correct solution
and when you need to keep working.

Please do not look for solutions online.
Doing so constitutes cheating.
The authors have introduced randomness into the assignments
so solutions posted by others may be wrong anyway.

You will use Linux for all lab work.
For some labs, you will be given a binary
that works on the CSE machines,
but should probably work on any recent vintage of Linux.
For others, you are required to develop code for a Linux box.
You may use any machine to develop,
but \emph{it must run correctly on the CSE machines}.
You must check your work on the machines in the laboratories
before submitting it.

Most low-level systems code is written in~C,
and you will be required to do the same.
You will also be required to read, understand, generate,
or otherwise fiddle with x86 assembly on a Linux box.

\section{Evaluation}

The grading scheme for the course will be announced in the next few days.
