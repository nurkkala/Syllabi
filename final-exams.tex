Students must take their final examinations at the assigned hours
listed in the schedule of classes.
Exceptions will be made only because of serious illness
or the death of an immediate member of the family.
Reasons such as
plane schedules,
availability of flights,
and rides leaving early
are not acceptable exceptions.
Students having more than two examinations on the same
should report this to the Registrar's Office
\emph{ten days prior to the beginning of finals week}.
Reasonable alternatives in alleviating this dilemma
will be pursued by the registrar
and the student in consultation with the appropriate faculty.
