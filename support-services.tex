\subsection{Writing Center}

Writing Center tutors can help you on all of your writing
in any stage of your writing process,
but they will usually focus on content and organization
before they look at grammar and style.
Expect to be actively involved during your session,
whether you are developing a better thesis,
reorganizing your main points,
or consulting a style manual to understand formatting rules.
