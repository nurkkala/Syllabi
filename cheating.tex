As a student at an institution whose goal is to honor Christ in all that it does,
I expect you to uphold the strictest standards of academic integrity.
You must do your own work,
cite others when you present their work,
and never misrepresent your academic performance in any way.
Violation of these standards stains the reputations of you as a student,
Taylor as an institution,
and Jesus as our Lord.

Every assignment should indicate clearly
that it is either:
\begin{itemize}
\item An \textbf{individual} assignment,
  to be done \emph{entirely by you},
  without any direct participation from other students.
\item A \textbf{group} assignment, to be done \emph{collectively with a group}
\end{itemize}
Unless otherwise stated,
assignments are \textbf{individual} assignments.

\begin{framed}
Note that you are \emph{always} welcome
to get help from the instructor.
\end{framed}

A violation of academic integrity may result in your failing the course
and other disciplinary action by the University.
Refer to the Taylor catalog for the official statement of these ideas.

\subsection{What Constitutes Cheating?}

For purposes of this course, the following are \emph{non-exhaustive} examples
of violations of academic integrity.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sharing code or other electronic files by copying, retyping, looking at,
  or supplying a copy of a file from this or a previous semester. Be sure to
  store your work in protected directories, and screen lock or log off a lab
  machine to prevent others from copying your work without your explicit
  assistance.
\item Sharing written assignments or exams by looking at, copying, or supplying
  an assignment or exam.
\item Using other's code. Using code from this or previous offerings of the
  class, from courses at other institutions, or from any other source (e.g.,
  software found on the Internet).
\item Looking at other's code. Although mentioned above, it bears
  repeating. Looking at other students' code or allowing others to look at yours
  is cheating. There is no notion of looking “too much,” since no looking is
  allowed at all.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Does Not Constitute Cheating?}

In contrast, the following are non-exhaustive examples of activities
that \emph{do not} violate academic integrity.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clarifying ambiguities or vague points in class handouts or textbooks.
\item Helping others use the computer systems, networks, compilers, debuggers,
  profilers, or other system facilities.
\item Helping others with high-level design issues.
\item Helping others with high-level (not code-based) debugging.
\item Using code from the \texttt{CS:APP} website or from the class web pages.
\end{enumerate}

Be sure to store your work in protected directories,
and log off when you leave an open cluster,
to prevent others from copying your work
without your explicit assistance.
